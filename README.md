# Usage

When a user chooses the Bitshares method, they will be
presented with an order summary as the next step (prices are shown in whatever
currency they've selected for shopping). Upon confirming their order, the system
takes the user to the Bithshares Checkout.  Once payment is received, the Bithshares Checkout
will redirect the user back to the merchant website.

In your Admin control panel, you can see the orders made via Bitshares just as
you could see for any other payment mode.  The status you selected in the
configuration steps above will indicate whether the order has been paid for.
